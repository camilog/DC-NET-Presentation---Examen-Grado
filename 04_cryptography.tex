    \begin{block}{Pedersen Commitments}
        A \emph{Pedersen commitment scheme} ($\mathcal{PC}$)  allows one to commit to a value while keeping it hidden to others, with the ability to reveal the committed value later. A $\mathcal{PC}$ achieves unconditionally hiding and computationally binding.\\
        Let $s$ be a secret value, $r$ a random value and $g,h$ generators of a group $G_q$, a \emph{Pedersen commitment} on value s is:
        $$c := g^s h^r$$

        A Zero-Knowledge protocol is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true, without conveying any information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true.
