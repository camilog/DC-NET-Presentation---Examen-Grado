\begin{frame}{Real Round - Proof of Knowledge on $M_i$}
    \begin{block}<1->{Informal Property}
        Participant will generate a commitment for $M_i$ using the commitments created in the previous step, and with that a PoK for the message $M_i$ inside that commitment.
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}<2>{Data Sending}
        $P_i$ calculates $c_M = f(c_m, c_b, c_\mathtt{pad})$\\
        $P_i$ extracts the value $r_M$ inside $c_M$ calculated before.\\
        $P_i$ generates: $\mathtt{PoK}_M = PoK\{(M, r_M): c_M = g^{M} h^{r_M}\}$\\
        $P_i$ sends the proof, and the rest of the participants need to check that the proof is valid using the commitments received in the previous step.
