    \begin{block}{Informal Property}
        Participant generates a commitment and a PoK for $O_i$ (established before), and the rest of the participants will check the proof using the values of commitments received in previous steps. $P_i$ will send this proof and the value $O_i$ itself.
        
        After that, each $O_i$ of the participants will be added in order to construct the round message $C^{(1)}$.

        $P_i$ calculates $r_{O} = r_{M} + r_{K}$\\
        Then calculates the commitment $c_{r_O} = h^{r_O}$\\
        Generates $\mathtt{PoK_{r_O}} = PoK\{r_O:c_{r_O} = h^{r_O}\}$ and sends it along $O_i$ to the rest of the room.\\
        The rest of participants calculate commitment for each $O_j$ received as $c_O = c_K \cdot c_M$\\
        After this will calculate the value $\beta = c_O \cdot (g^O)^{-1}$, and with this value will verify $\mathtt{PoK_{r_O}}$\\
        Finally will calculate $C^{(1)} = \sum O_j$
