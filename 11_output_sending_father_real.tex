    \begin{block}<1-1>{Informal Property}
        Participant sends $O_i$ and a proof verifying that the message is either 0 or is the same message that was involved in the collision in the father round.
        
        Same as before, all $O_i$ will be added in order to construct the round message $C^{(k)}$
