\begin{frame}{Real Round - Sending $O_i$ when father round is virtual}
    \begin{block}{Informal Property}
        Participant sends $O_i$ and a proof verifying that the message is either 0 or is the same message that was involved in the last real round played in the direct branch between the current round and the first one. Also needs to prove that this message wasn't involved in real rounds produced in later real rounds of other branches.
        
        Same as before, all $O_i$ will be added in order to construct the round message $C^{(k)}$
