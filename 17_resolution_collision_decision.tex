\begin{frame}{Collision Round}
    \begin{block}{$t > 1$}
        All the participants that sent a message in this round need to calculate: $\overline{M} = M^*/t$\\
        If his message $M_i < \overline{M}$, will resend his message in the round $2k$\\
        If not, the participant will resend his message in the round $2k+1$ (which is virtual, so technically won't resend his message).
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}<2>{Aftermath}
        The current round is over, and a new round (if it is the case) will start, redoing all the previous steps described.
    \end{block}
