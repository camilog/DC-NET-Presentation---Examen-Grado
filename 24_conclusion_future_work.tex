\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

\begin{frame}{Future Work}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Security analysis of the implemented API.
        \item Testing in more real scenarios.
        \item UX improvements to mobile app.
        \item Use elliptic curve cryptography.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Protocol suitable for low-interactive scenarios (anonymous bulletin board).
        \item DC-Nets are a valid option to replace onion-routing in some scenarios that require anonymous messaging.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Implemented Tool and Proposed Scenario}
\justify
It was implemented a \textbf{practical mobile app} that it's suitable for \textbf{local network environments} with a \textbf{low number of participants} where the anonymity is desirable, for example, an small organization where members can \textbf{complaint anonymously about abuses perpetrated by peers or superiors}.
